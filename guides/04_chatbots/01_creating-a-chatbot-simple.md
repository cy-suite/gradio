## Introduction

Chatbots are a popular application of large language models. Because chatbots are designed to be used directly by customers and end users, it is important to validate that chatbots are behaving as expected when confronted with a wide variety of input prompts.

Using `gradio`, you can easily build a demo of your chatbot model and share that with your users, or try it yourself using an intuitive chatbot GUI.

This tutorial will highlight `gr.ChatbotInterface()` which is a high-level abstraction that allows you to create your chatbot UI with a single line of code. The chatbot interface that we create will look something like this:



We'll start with a toy example, and then show how to use `gr.ChatbotInterface()` with several popular APIs and libraries for creating chatbots, including `langchain`, `openai`, and Hugging Face.
