00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
There's been international condemnation of the self-styled referendums being held in

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.700
parts of Ukraine on joining Russia. The G7, the group of seven wealthiest nations, have

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.040
called the votes a sham as reports emerged of Russian forces intimidating people to vote.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.800
These are the four areas where voting is being held. They include occupied parts of Luhansk

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.760
and Donetsk in the east, Saperizhzhya and Kherson in the south, and cover around 15

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.080
percent of Ukraine's territory. Voting is expected to run until Tuesday and the result

7
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.360
seems almost certain to go in Moscow's favour. These pictures, filmed in Russian-occupied

8
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.640
Donetsk, show representatives taking polling cards to people in their own homes. Here,

9
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.680
at least, it's not a secret ballot. Meanwhile, Russia is continuing to mobilise its reserve

10
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.880
troops with the latest. Here's our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. It was the moment

11
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.280
the Kremlin tried to show the people still back their president and what he's doing in

12
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.480
Ukraine. Within days, Vladimir Putin is expected to annex a huge swathe of Ukrainian territory.

13
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.120
There's international condemnation, but at home, the official picture is they trust Putin.

14
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.880
Many of the people here, though, didn't trust us. When we asked the simple question,

15
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.380
why have you come to this rally? There was a certain reluctance to answer. But they had

16
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.320
something to say on the subject of mobilisation. The call-up is worrying everyone with relatives

17
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.960
of fighting age, Natalia says. Not Viera. I'd be much happier if my son got wounded

18
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.400
fighting in Ukraine than die of alcoholism here, she says. Fighting is a proper man's

19
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.060
job. This is not a spontaneous display of love for Vladimir Putin and his policies.

20
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.720
It is a highly choreographed affair designed to give the impression that the whole country

21
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.760
is behind the president. A lot of the people we've spoken to here today have been brought

22
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.360
in specially from schools, from factories and other state organisations.

23
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.280
In Ukraine today, in those areas occupied by Russian troops, self-styled referendums

24
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.640
began on joining Russia. The West has denounced the votes as a sham, a smokescreen for annexation

25
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.560
by Moscow. Back in Russia, more goodbyes, more men called up to fight in Ukraine.

26
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.440
There's growing concern here that the scale of mobilisation is far greater than the Kremlin

27
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.240
have let on. Emotions are running high. Why have you taken our sons? A mother is heard

28
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.120
asking this officer. When he tells the audience that his own son isn't eligible for the call-up,

29
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:12.840
listen to the reaction. For the president, this could become a problem. Vladimir Putin

30
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.600
once promised Russians stability. Now he's sending them to the front line. Persuading

31
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.400
Russians to keep faith in him won't be easy. Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow.

32
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.600
And now we can talk to our correspondent in Kiev, Hugo Bashega. Hugo, what is the response

33
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.320
in Kiev to these referendums?

34
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.080
The Ukrainians are saying that this is a farce. There's no legal basis for this so-called

35
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.600
referendum. And I think the message has been a similar message that has been coming out

36
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.420
from Western countries, that this is an illegal process that is being used by Moscow as perhaps

37
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.200
a justification for the annexation of parts of Ukraine. I think we all know how this is

38
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.760
going to go. I think there was a poll that was released by Russian state media yesterday

39
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.800
saying that between 80 and 90 per cent of voters in these occupied areas where this

40
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.040
so-called referendum is being held are in favour of joining Russia. So I think it gives

41
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.840
us a sense of what we can expect in terms of the official results of this so-called

42
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.480
referendum. But we're hearing reports from those areas saying that soldiers are going

43
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.120
door to door, forcing people to vote. People are saying that they're being threatened in

44
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.120
those areas. And Ukrainian officials are saying that the population has been banned from leaving

45
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.120
some towns and cities where this vote is taking place. But here in Ukraine, the officials

46
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.280
are saying that this doesn't change anything and that they will continue with their counteroffensive

47
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.920
to retake territory that's now under Russian occupation. So what do they expect to happen

48
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.000
next and whether these referendums could change the course of the conflict? So obviously I

49
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.080
think the fear is that this is going to be used by Moscow as a reason to perhaps step

50
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.240
up their military activity. They could say, well, look, these areas are now part of Russian

51
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.480
territory and we're going to defend them as if they are part of Russia. So I think this

52
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.080
is the main fear. Even though authorities here are dismissing the vote, they say that

53
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.980
things are not going to change. But I think we need to wait to see what Russia is going

54
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:43.280
to do as a response to this vote. The vote started yesterday. It is being held in areas

55
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.840
in four different regions of the country and the so-called referendum is expected to be

56
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.560
held until Tuesday. So then we are expecting to hear the official results after this vote

57
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.520
then. And this of course is going to backdrop a further mobilisation in Russia. Does Ukraine

58
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:09.400
see that as a threat? I think the response that I got from a top adviser to President

59
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.360
Zelensky was that this was more a response from Russia to its defeat on the battlefield.

60
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.560
There was a little bit of criticism, especially on state television in Russia. And here the

61
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.600
view is that President Putin had to do something. I think the view here is that it is going

62
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.880
to take a long time for these people to be trained, to receive military training and

63
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.160
equipment. And we're talking about perhaps 90 days between the point of these people

64
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160
being recruited and the moment they arrive here in Ukraine. So they think that this is

65
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.340
not something that is going to cause a lot of concern for now. But again, they're using

66
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:57.240
it as another reason to request more military aid from Western partners. And they believe

67
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:12.320
that this is Russia's response to the defeats on the battlefield.
