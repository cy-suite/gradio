# 0.1.1

First public release of the Gradio Client library! The `gradio_client` Python library that makes it very easy to use any Gradio app as an API. 

As an example, consider this [Hugging Face Space that transcribes audio files](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/whisper) that are recorded from the microphone.

Using the `gradio_client` library, we can easily use the Gradio as an API to transcribe audio files programmatically.

Here's the entire code to do it:

```python
from gradio_client import Client

client = Client("abidlabs/whisper") 
client.predict("audio_sample.wav")  

>> "This is a test of the whisper speech recognition model."
```
