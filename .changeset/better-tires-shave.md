#### Automatically delete state after user has disconnected from the webpage

Gradio now automatically deletes `gr.State` variables stored in the server's RAM when users close their browser tab.
The deletion will happen 60 minutes after the server detected a disconnect from the user's browser.
If the user connects again in that timeframe, their state will not be deleted.

Additionally, Gradio now includes a `Blocks.unload()` event, allowing you to run arbitrary cleanup functions when users disconnect (this does not have a 60 minute delay).
You can think of the `unload` event as the opposite of the `load` event.


```python
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown(
"""# State Cleanup Demo
üñºÔ∏è Images are saved in a user-specific directory and deleted when the users closes the page via demo.unload.
""")
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column(scale=1):
            with gr.Row():
                img = gr.Image(label="Generated Image", height=300, width=300)
            with gr.Row():
                gen = gr.Button(value="Generate")
            with gr.Row():
                history = gr.Gallery(label="Previous Generations", height=500, columns=10)
                state = gr.State(value=[], delete_callback=lambda v: print("STATE DELETED"))

    demo.load(generate_random_img, [state], [img, state, history]) 
    gen.click(generate_random_img, [state], [img, state, history])
    demo.unload(delete_directory)


demo.launch(auth=lambda user,pwd: True,
            auth_message="Enter any username and password to continue")
```
