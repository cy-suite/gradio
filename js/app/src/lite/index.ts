// with which users can use Gradio by loading only one JS file,
// without a link tag referring to the CSS file.

// because it will be refactored in the near future.
// As a result, the users of the Wasm app will have to load the CSS file manually.

/**
 * I'm not sure if this is a correct way to export functions from a bundle created with Vite.
 * However, at least, the library mode (https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode)
 * with an exported function (`export async function create()`) didn't work for our case.
 * In library mode with the `build.lib.entry = (this file)` config,
 * Vite creates a bundle exporting the functions from this file, which looks nice,
 * however, it inevitably enables inlining of all the static file assets,
 * while we need to disable inlining for the wheel files to pass their URLs to `micropip.install()`.
 *
 * > If you specify build.lib, build.assetsInlineLimit will be ignored and assets will always be inlined, regardless of file size or being a Git LFS placeholder.
 * > https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-assetsinlinelimit
 *
 * There is an open issue about this: https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4454
 *
 * FYI, stlite (https://github.com/whitphx/stlite) uses Webpack,
 * which supports bundling libraries that export entities to the global scope and disabling assets inlining
 * (https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/).
