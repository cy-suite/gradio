#  Welcome to Gradio

Quickly create customizable UI components around your models. Gradio makes it easy for you to "play around" with your model in your browser by dragging-and-dropping in your own images, pasting your own text, recording your own voice, etc. and seeing what the model outputs.  

![Interface montage](demo/screenshots/montage.gif)

Gradio is useful for:

* Creating demos of your machine learning code for clients / collaborators / users

* Getting feedback on model performance from users

* Debugging your model interactively during development


## Getting Started
You can find an interactive version of this README at [https://gradio.app/getting_started](https://gradio.app/getting_started).

### Quick Start

To get Gradio running with a simple example, follow these three steps:

<span>1.</span> Install Gradio from pip.

```bash
pip install gradio
```

<span>2.</span> Run the code below as a Python script or in a Python notebook (or in a  [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18ODkJvyxHutTN0P5APWyGFO_xwNcgHDZ?usp=sharing)).

$code_hello_world

<span>3.</span> The interface below will appear automatically within the Python notebook, or pop in a browser on  [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860/)  if running from a script.

$demo_hello_world

### The Interface

Gradio can wrap almost any Python function with an easy to use interface. That function could be anything from a simple tax calculator to a pretrained model.

The core  `Interface`  class is initialized with three parameters:

-   `fn`: the function to wrap
-   `inputs`: the input component type(s)
-   `outputs`: the output component type(s)

With these three arguments, we can quickly create interfaces and  `launch()`  them. But what if you want to change how the UI components look or behave?

### Customizable Components

What if we wanted to customize the input text field - for example, we wanted it to be larger and have a text hint? If we use the actual input class for  `Textbox`  instead of using the string shortcut, we have access to much more customizability. To see a list of all the components we support and how you can customize them, check out the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs)

$code_hello_world_2
$demo_hello_world_2

### Multiple Inputs and Outputs

Let's say we had a much more complex function, with multiple inputs and outputs. In the example below, we have a function that takes a string, boolean, and number, and returns a string and number. Take a look how we pass a list of input and output components.

$code_hello_world_3
$demo_hello_world_3

We simply wrap the components in a list. Furthermore, if we wanted to compare multiple functions that have the same input and return types, we can even pass a list of functions for quick comparison.

### Working with Images

Let's try an image to image function. When using the  `Image`  component, your function will receive a numpy array of your specified size, with the shape  `(width, height, 3)`, where the last dimension represents the RGB values. We'll return an image as well in the form of a numpy array.

$code_sepia_filter
$demo_sepia_filter

Additionally, our  `Image`  input interface comes with an 'edit' button which opens tools for cropping, flipping, rotating, drawing over, and applying filters to images. We've found that manipulating images in this way will often reveal hidden flaws in a model.

In addition to images, Gradio supports other media input types, such as audio or video uploads. Read about these in the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs).

### Working with Data

You can use Gradio to support inputs and outputs from your typical data libraries, such as numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, and plotly graphs. Take a look at the demo below (ignore the complicated data manipulation in the function!)

$code_sales_projections
$demo_sales_projections

### Example Inputs

You can provide example data that a user can easily load into the model. This can be helpful to demonstrate the types of inputs the model expects, as well as to provide a way to explore your dataset in conjunction with your model. To load example data, you provide a **nested list** to the  `examples=`  keyword argument of the Interface constructor. Each sublist within the outer list represents a data sample, and each element within the sublist represents an input for each input component. The format of example data for each component is specified in the  [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs).

$code_calculator
$demo_calculator

You can load a large dataset into the examples to browse and interact with the dataset through Gradio. The examples will be automatically paginated (you can configure this through the `examples_per_page` argument of Interface) and you can use CTRL + arrow keys to navigate through the examples quickly.

### Live Interfaces

You can make interfaces automatically responsive by setting `live=True` in the interface. Now the interface will recalculate as soon as the user input.

$code_calculator_live
$demo_calculator_live

Note there is no submit button, because the interface resubmits automatically on change.

### Using State

Your function may use data that persists beyond a single function call. If the data is something accessible to all function calls, you can create a global variable outside the function call and access it inside the function. For example, you may load a large model outside the function and use it inside the function so that every function call does not need to reload the model.

Another type of data persistence Gradio supports is session state, where data persists across multiple submits within a page load. To store data with this permanence, use `gr.get_state` and `gr.set_state` methods.

$code_chatbot
$demo_chatbot

Notice how the state persists across submits within each page, but the state is not shared between the two pages.

### Flagging

Underneath the output interfaces, there is a button marked "Flag". When a user testing your model sees input with interesting output, such as erroneous or unexpected model behaviour, they can flag the input for the interface creator to review. Within the directory provided by the  `flagging_dir=`  argument to the Interface constructor, a CSV file will log the flagged inputs. If the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well.

For example, with the calculator interface shown above, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:

```directory
+-- calculator.py
+-- flagged/
|   +-- logs.csv
```

*flagged/logs.csv*
```csv
num1,operation,num2,Output
5,add,7,12
6,subtract,1.5,4.5
```

With the sepia interface shown above, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:

```directory
+-- sepia.py
+-- flagged/
|   +-- logs.csv
|   +-- im/
|   |   +-- 0.png
|   |   +-- 1.png
|   +-- Output/
|   |   +-- 0.png
|   |   +-- 1.png
```

*flagged/logs.csv*
```csv
im,Output
im/0.png,Output/0.png
im/1.png,Output/1.png
```

You can review these flagged inputs by manually exploring the flagging directory, or load them into the examples of the Gradio interface by pointing the  `examples=`  argument to the flagged directory. If you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of the strings when flagging, which will be saved as an additional column to the CSV.

### Sharing Interfaces Publicly & Privacy

Interfaces can be easily shared publicly by setting `share=True` in the `launch()` method. Like this:

```python
gr.Interface(classify_image, "image", "label").launch(share=True)
```

This generates a public, shareable link that you can send to anybody! When you send this link, the user on the other side can try out the model in their browser. Because the processing happens on your device (as long as your device stays on!), you don't have to worry about any dependencies. If you're working out of colab notebook, a share link is always automatically created. It usually looks something like this:  **XXXXX.gradio.app**. Although the link is served through a gradio link, we are only a proxy for your local server, and do not store any data sent through the interfaces.

Keep in mind, however, that these links are publicly accessible, meaning that anyone can use your model for prediction! Therefore, make sure not to expose any sensitive information through the functions you write, or allow any critical changes to occur on your device. If you set `share=False` (the default), only a local link is created, which can be shared by  [port-forwarding](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example)  with specific users. 

Share links expire after 72 hours. For permanent hosting, see below.

![Sharing diagram](demo/images/sharing.svg)

### Authentication

You may wish to put an authentication page in front of your interface to limit access. With the `auth=` keyword argument in the `launch()` method, you can pass a list of acceptable username/password tuples; or, for custom authentication handling, pass a function that takes a username and password as arguments, and returns True to allow authentication, False otherwise.

### Permanent Hosting

You can share your interface publicly and permanently by hosting on Gradio's infrastructure. You will need to create a Gradio premium account. First, log into Gradio on [gradio.app](https://gradio.app) and click Sign In at the top. Once you've logged in with your Github account, you can specify which repositories from your Github profile you'd like to have hosted by Gradio. You must also specify the file within the repository that runs the Gradio `launch()` command. Once you've taken these steps, Gradio will launch your interface and provide a public link you can share.

## Advanced Features

### Interpretation

Most models are black boxes such that the internal logic of the function is hidden from the end user. To encourage transparency, we've added the ability for interpretation so that users can understand what parts of the input are responsible for the output. Take a look at the simple interface below:

$code_gender_sentence_default_interpretation
$demo_gender_sentence_default_interpretation

Notice the  `interpretation`  keyword argument. We're going to use Gradio's default interpreter here. After you submit and click Interpret, you'll see the interface automatically highlights the parts of the text that contributed to the final output orange! The parts that conflict with the output are highlight blue.

You can also write your own interpretation function. The demo below adds custom interpretation to the previous demo. This function will take the same inputs as the main wrapped function. The output of this interpretation function will be used to highlight the input of each input interface - therefore the number of outputs here corresponds to the number of input interfaces. To see the format for interpretation for each input interface, check the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs).

$code_gender_sentence_custom_interpretation
$demo_gender_sentence_custom_interpretation

If you use Gradio's default interpretation, the output component must be a label or a number. All input components are supported for default interpretation. Below is an example with image input.

$code_image_classifier
$demo_image_classifier
